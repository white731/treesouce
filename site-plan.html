      <!-- ------------------------Steps 2-3------------------------------ -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to create an online rental marketplace where people can rent everyday household goods to and from people in their area - like Airbnb, but for everything else. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Have you ever wanted to try something new like play the guitar or ride a mountain bike but wanted to test it out first before spending a ton of money? With my website, you can do just that. Search for items in your area that are for rent and try them out for a fraction of the cost of buying them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Have you ever bought something that you've only used once and is now collecting dust in your garage? With my website, you can turn those items into cash-generating assets by listing for them rent online.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is currently no centralized location on the internet where people can securely rent to and from people in their community. I want to change that.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will consist of Millenials that now entering into the world of adulthood. They're having kids, buying homes and realizing 
        the realities of what it takes to be adults. But because we live in a new world different than our parents, they're part of the "share" generation. 
        They're used to staying in other peoples homes (airbnb) or riding in a strangers car (uber). They'll be comfortable renting a lawn mower from the neighbor or 
        renting a chainsaw to cut down a big tree instead of having to own these things like their parents did. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-558eb4-41085e-df2935" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ffffff-558eb4-41085e-df2935</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#FFFFFF</td><td class="secondary">#558EB4</td><td class="accent1">#41085E</td><td class="accent2">#DF2935</td></tr>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Satisfy <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I like this font because its fun and neigborly. It lends itself well to the brand. You feel very welcome when you read things in it.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Raleway  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Very simple, and slightly more spacious font. Super easy to read. I really like how it pairs with the heading font <!-- change this -->

      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Hey Neighbor! Welcome to the neighborhood! We’re a community of people who are all about sharing what we have with our neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live in a world that shares a lot (AND THAT’S GOOD!). We share our experience, our knowledge (thanks internet), our cars and even our homes! But most people don’t share their “Stuff”. Stuff like a bike, guitar, hammer, camera, game console… the list goes on and on. We all have some of these things but most don’t have all, so let’s share! 
      </p>  
      <h3>Borrowing</h3>
      <p>
        How are you supposed borrow stuff? Hey Neighbor! That’s what we’re here for! We’ve created a neighborhood of borrowers and lenders who can now find each other in this share driven world. It’s easy. Just head over to “The Neighborhood” and start searching for “Stuff”. If you can’t find what you’re looking for then “ask a neighbor” and more than likely someone will reach out. 
      </p>  
      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        What if I want to share stuff?  If you have something you own that you want to share with others in your community you can post it right here in the neighborhood. Members of your community will get to see it and eventually borrow it. You can choose to charge for the things you share or you can share it for free. It’s up to you!
      </p>    
    <h3>We've got you covered</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes sharing things can be a little scary. We want community members to feel safe and secure as they share the things they own with others. When you share an item with another you can choose to have it insured for a small price or request that the neighbor who is borrowing it puts up the full value of the item up front in case it gets broken or stolen. We also rate our members after each share so that other members can barrow and lend with confidence. 
      </p>

      <h3>The Neighborhood</h3>
      <p>
        Hey Neighbor! Welcome to the neighborhood. Browse through all kinds of stuff that’s available to borrow in the neighborhood. You can search by category, location, and much more!
      </p>  
      <h3>Ask a Neighbor</h3>
      <p>  
      Can’t find what you’re looking for? You can submit a request to the neighborhood to see if anyone has it available to share.

      <h3>Join the Neighborhood</h3>
      <p>
        Joining the neighborhood is super easy, just sign up using the form below. By becoming a part of the neighborhood you’ll get to view all items that are available from neighbors just like yourself. Most communities have hundreds of items available to share with one another. Another benefit of becoming a member of the neighborhood is that YOU can start sharing your stuff too. After you sign up you’ll be guided through the process of how to list items to share. Note that there are rules and stipulations that surround what can be listed to share. See below for more details.
